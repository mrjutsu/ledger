# Ledger

## Introduction

Ledger is a package that aims to offer a nonrepudiation service by letting you log every single action performed on an Eloquent model. Ledger will help you know who did what when.

##Â Installation

## Default Behavior

By default Ledger will log actions performed

## Limitations

Currently Ledger is in its early stages and considerable shaping is necessary and will definitely come. Having said that, these are its current limitations:

- Only basic CRUD actions are logged (`created`, `updated`, `deleted`, `forceDeleted`).
- When a model is permanently deleted, currently there's no way to properly identify what was deleted.
- A `user_id` is required when creating a new log record, this means actions performed in environments like `tinker` will fail as there's no user to match the action to.
- Actions logged are very simple and currently there is no support for custom ones, like logging a download, for example.

## Roadmap

Ledger is a package I'm expanding and maintaining in my free time, so I won't be able to provide a specific time on when a new feature, fix or improvement will be released.
